*International tender database*

**Version 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT**

## About

The goal of this project is to gather, store and serve tender information from various countries. Data should be available on a web interface as well as via an API which serves [OCDS](http://standard.open-contracting.org/) records.

The main data source is [TED](http://ted.europa.eu/), and the importer we implemented is using TED-XML provided by TED's public FTP server.
